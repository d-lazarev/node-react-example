# React/Node Challenge
This is a challenge that a prospective employer had given. They originally wanted a page listing the bus routes and the predicted times to a stop. I took it a bit further an made a full stack single page solution combining Node.js on the back-end and React on the front.

For the purposes of this example, they are bundled as a client and api server which are both run individually and will listen on their own ports. In the real world, this would be containerized.

While all attempts have been made to keep this both clean and functionally coherent, please keep in mind that I am a developer and I usually work with UX designers to ensure that the pages match their design specifications.
