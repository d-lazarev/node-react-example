# React/Node Challenge
This is a challenge that a prospective employer had given. They originally wanted a page listing the bus routes and the predicted times to a stop. I took it a bit further an made an full stack solution out of Node.js and React.

I bundled them together in this example. Normally, this would be containerized in the real world.

It's not meant to be pretty as I am a developer and not a designer. This is only meant as an example full-stack solution.
